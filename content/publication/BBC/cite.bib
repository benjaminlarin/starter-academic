  abstract  = {Pronounced and persistent fluctuations in aggregate wealth and real activity - boom-bust episodes - have become more prevalent in recent history. In this paper I provide a quantitative explanation for such boom-bust episodes that is based on rational bubbles. To this end, I set up an overlapping generations model with many generations, financial frictions, aggregate uncertainty and rational bubbles. The calibrated model generates empirically plausible bubble-driven business cycles. I decompose the macroeconomic effect of rational bubbles into several different channels and use the calibrated model to asses their relative strength. The decomposition shows that one particular channel that operates through the creation of bubbles is necessary for plausible bubbles to exist. I then apply the model to replicate the observed series of real output and aggregate wealth during the two recent US boom-bust episodes between 1990 and 2010. By decomposing the model-implied series for aggregate wealth I show that almost all of the fluctuations in aggregate wealth can be explained as a result of stochastic rational bubbles.},
