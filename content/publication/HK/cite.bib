  abstract  = {There are, by now, several long term, time series data sets on important housing & macro variables, such as land prices, house prices, and the housing wealth-to-income ratio. However, an appropriate theory that can be employed to think about such data and associated research questions has been lacking. We present a new housing & macro model that is designed specifically to analyze the long term. The calibrated model replicates the historical evolution of housing wealth after World War II and suggests a further considerable increase in the future. It also implies a surge in the land price and the house price.},
